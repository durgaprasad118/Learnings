# React
- React element => object
- when we render this into the dom then it becomes html element

## JSX

- JSX (javaScript xml) => (not react)
- => JSX is html like syntax
- => JSX is not html in js
- => Not a proper js because js engine cannot undersatnd jsx
- => parcel(Babel) transpiles jsx to smthing js engine can understand
- => JSX =>(babel) react.createElement => object => html element
- camelCase is used for attributes

## Components

- class based components (old way)
- functional component (new way)
  FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT => JS FUNCTION which returns some piece of jsx
- USE captial letter
- if single line no need of return as it is arrow function
- if multi line ( ) used
- method 1 `<Heading Component/>`
- Method 2 `<HeadingComponent></HeadingComponent>`
- we can pass element or functional component in one another
- fucntional component returns only one
- WE can call component using `{func()}`

## style

- for writing style inline
- `style={{bgc:"red",....}}`

## props
- arguments to a function => while calling function we do `func(2)` here 2 is argument in react we call it as props
- prop is an object
- so we destructure for easier writing since it is an object
- destructing ` const {name, cuisine}=props`
- instead of `(props)` we write `({name, cuisine, rating, time})`
- while accessing instead of writing `prop.name` we can write `name`

## Config driven UI

- driven by config (lastest practice used )
- config is given by api
- diferent for delhi, kolkata, etc..
- if offers are there in banglore it shows in carousel if im veiewing for kolkata it doesnt show

## keys
- to identify uniqely the child
- if keys are not there then all childs are treated same and rerenders everything
- if key is there then it uniquely identifies and renders that particular thing insted of re-rednering all items
- index is not used because => react documentation says using index is bad practice

  # JavaScript
   ## Optional Chaining
- The `?.` operator checks if the property on the left side (person.address) exists and is not `null or undefined`. If it is, the expression continues, and the property on the right side (city) is accessed. If, at any point, a property is `null or undefined`, the expression returns `undefined`, and the rest of the chain is skipped.
  

## destructuring  objects
```js
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  occupation: 'Engineer',
};
//destructuring 
const { name, age, occupation } = person;
// renaming
const { name: personName, age: personAge, occupation: job } = person;

//default
const { name, age, gender = 'Unknown' } = person;
If the gender property is missing in the person object, the gender variable will be assigned the default value 'Unknown'.
```

## Comparison function sorting
```js
const numbers = [5, 2, 8, 1, 10, 3];
// Sorting in ascending order
numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);
// descending order
numbers.sort((a,b)=> b-a)
```
-  `(a, b) => a - b` is used as a comparison function=> ascending order  
-  If the result of the function is negative, `a comes before b`. If the result is positive, `b comes before a`. If the result is zero, the order of `a and b remains unchanged.`

  # CSS
- for `hr` to get desired height use height and `border:none`
- #e2e3e7
- #ededed color
- inner image of card use `width:100%` of parent so that it fits inside corectly
- keep parent as `relative` and child as `absolute ` for positioning as desired
  
# Markdown
This is **really** important and to *stand out*  your markdown should be good
- item 1
- item 2
- [ ] chekd item after - only
- [ ] this is an unchecked item
- [x] THis is a checked item

![Alt text](link)
This is how you use `console.log`

```js
const a =1;
console.log(a);
```


changes
```diff
-const a=1;
-console.log(a);
+const b=1;
+cosnole.log(b);
return a;
```
