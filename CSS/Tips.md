# CSS
- ensure u have images of `same sizes height and width` like one is landscape and other is protrait doesn't fit
- for hr to get desired height use height and `border:none`
- inner image of card use `width:100%` of parent so that it fits inside corectly
- keep `parent-relative` and `child-absolute`  for positioning as desired
- **setting width of the button to particular px doesn't affect the text change in the button**
- centering the div using margin
  ```css
  margin: 0 auto;
  ```
- keeping `width:70%` to some percent gives % width of container
