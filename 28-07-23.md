# Routing

- Named import

```js
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider, Outlet } from "react-router-dom";
```

- whenever we need to create route we need to write routing configuration
- We create configuration(some info that will tell what will happen on a specific route)
- `createBrowserRouter` takes a list of [path(an object ) , what should happen on path]
- while rendering use `<RouterProvider router={appRouter}/>`
- ErrorELement => if something wrong happens it goes to this specific page
- `reacter-router-dom` also gives `useRouterError` hook
- this gives more information about the error

# building header constant and displaying the respective things in the body

- to do this we need to create childern routes
- we use `outlet`
- according to the path it fills there

# linking to the anchor tags
- `in the end it is anchor tag`
- if we use `a and href="path"` it will take to the desired page but
- NEVER USE Anchor tag for navigatig
- if we use that whole page gets refreshed
- so react helps to navigate without getting whole page refreshed
- router helps => to use links
- `Link to="path from router"` to easily make them clickable
- using this the whole page doesn't load only the requried thing loads
# In the end it is converted to anchor tag in html so for removing blue links use td:none, and color;black
# React is known as single page application

- 2 types of routing in webapps
  1. **client side routing - we don't make network calls because all components are already loaded**
     - single page application we use `client side routing`
  2. server side routing - make a network call and the about us page comes from server


# Dynamic routing
- we build different pages for different restaurants


# Keys
- Keys tell React which array item each component corresponds to, so that it can match them up later. This becomes important if your array items can move (e.g. due to sorting), get inserted, or get deleted.
  - Keys must be unique among siblings. However, it’s okay to use the same keys for JSX nodes in different arrays.
  - Keys must not change or that defeats their purpose! Don’t generate them while rendering.
  - **You might be tempted to use an item’s index in the array as its key. In fact, that’s what React will use if you don’t specify a key at all. But the *order in which you render items will change over time if an item is inserted, deleted, or if the array gets reordered*. Index as a key often leads to subtle and confusing bugs**.
  - **Similarly, do not generate keys on the fly, e.g. with key={Math.random()}. *This will cause keys to never match up between renders*, leading to all your components and DOM being recreated every time. Not only is this slow, but it will also lose any user input inside the list items. Instead, use a stable ID based on the data.**
  - Note that your components won’t receive key as a prop. It’s only used as a hint by React itself. If your component needs an ID, you have to pass it as a separate prop: <Profile key={id} userId={id} />.
# Easy example
- Imagine that files on your desktop didn’t have names. Instead, you’d refer to them by their order — the first file, the second file, and so on. You could get used to it, but once you delete a file, it would get confusing. The second file would become the first file, the third file would be the second file, and so on.
- File names in a folder and JSX keys in an array serve a similar purpose. They let us uniquely identify an item between its siblings. A well-chosen key provides more information than the position within the array. Even if the position changes due to reordering, the key lets React identify the item throughout its lifetime.
# Key must be linked to parent jsx
