# Class based components

- `Functional component`- normal js function which returns some piece of jsx
- **Class based component**- class based component is a class which has a render method which returns a piece of jsx
- we will have a render method inside , this returns a piece of `jsx`
- use `extends React.component` to make class based component
- `React.component` is imported from `react`

- How do we receive props

  - we will create a constructor to receive props
  - we need to use `super`
  - Super props in class components refers to a method that is used to access the props of the parent component inside the constructor of the child component. When creating a class component, the constructor is responsible for initializing the component's state and binding event handlers. However, before we can access the props in the constructor, we need to call the super() method, which is used to call the constructor of the parent class (React.Component).

- By calling super(props), we pass the props object to the parent class's constructor, allowing the child component to access the props. This is especially useful when we need to set the initial state of the component based on the props passed down from the parent.

- **for passing props we create a constructor and use super(props)**
-

# state in react

- Earlier there are no hooks
- Loading a class based component is creating an `new instance of the class`
- if we need to create state variable we do it constructor

- ```js
     constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
      count2:1,
    };
  }

  ```

- we need to create `useState` two times in functional component but here only one is used
- for updating `this.setState({ count: count + 1 })`

# Life cycle methods

- While rendering if it encounters `class based component` a new instance of a class is created , `then the constructor is called` and `then render is called`
- if the parent is also class based component
  1. new instance of parent class is created
  2. `parent constructor` is called
  3. `parent render` is called
  4. `child constructor` is called
  5. `child render` is called

# apart from constructor and render method class based component also has `componentDidMount()` => _this will be called once the component is mounted_

1. component is called\*
2. render method is called
3. componentDidMount is called

# when both has mounts then

1. parent constructor
2. parent render
3. child constructor
4. child render
5. child mount
6. parent mount

# if there are multiple childs

1. parent constructor
2. parent render
   - **render phase of both children**
3. child 1 constructor
4. child 1 render
5. child 2 constructor
6. child 2 render
   - **DOM UPDATED - Batching**
7. child 1 mount
8. child 2 mount
9. parent mount

- This happended because render is done first of both childs and batches the render pahse of two childs
- _this two childs render phase is happened and then commit phase is batched_
- batching render phases of children
- then commit phase batchesup and start updating the `dom`

# This is done because=>

# componentDidMount()

# parent - child => inner child(child)

- parent constructor
- parent render
- child constructor
- child render
- inner child constructor
- inner child rnder
- inner child component did mount
- child component did mount
- parent component did moutn

- This will be called once the component is mounted
- This is used to make an Api call
- The way we call is `load -> render -> api call -> re-render`
- in the similar way of `useEffect()`

# important

- two phases
  1. render phase
     - `constructor is called`
     - `render is called`
  2. commit phase
     - DOM updates
     - componentDid Mount is called

# componentdidmount

- we can make this async function
  1. first constructor is called
  2. then render is clled with some dummy data
  3. now component did mount is called an api call is made
  4. Now we call `this.setState`
  -Till here mounting life cycle
  5. When we call the set state the it triggers reconciliation process now update cylce starts -> render method is started
  6. this render(api data) state variable updates **whenever there is a change in state variable react rerenders the components**
  7. Now user sees with New data(api data)
  8. Now `component did update is called`
  9. `Component will unmount is called when we unmount` like when we change the page
